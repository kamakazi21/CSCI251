The pre-processor takes pre-processor directives and applies them prior to the object code being generated, and then linked.
– Source file inclusion: #include
– Macro definition/replacement: #define
– Conditional compilation: #ifndef, #ifdef, #else, #endif
Use of the preprocessor:
– Can make the code easier to develop, read, and modify.
– Can make the C/C++ code portable, via conditional compilation, among different platforms.
– The #define, #ifdef, and #ifndef directives are sometimes referred to as header guards.
Definitions are often only allowed to be made once
To do this we use #define, which generally specifies a pre-processor variable used in the text of our program prior to the
rest of the compilation
Combined with #ifndef and #endif we can avoid multiple inclusion
