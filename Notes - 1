Programming- Writing instrucitons for a computer with the purpose of getting to perform required tasks.
Instructions are wwritten in aprogramming language which has a specified syntax.
Control Structures - using the results of test to determine where we go inside a particular program
Imperative Programming - specifying instructions as to how something is done.
Declarative Programming - specifying what the program should achieve.
Imperative Programming:
-Procedural Programming - Modularity, Scope, Black Box
-Object Oriented Programming - Object, Classes, Java
-Generic Programming - Templates, Parameterized Types
Java is used for implementing client server web applicaitons, platform independent
C++ is used for desktop applications and systems programming and application prgramming.
Compiler - Converts User Code to Machine Language
Java is good for standardization, safety and web programming, but less powerful as it has more layers
JVM manages resources.
.java -> .class (bytecode) -> turns it into native machine code
C++  - word file -> compiler -> Object File (binary) -> Linker (linkss to other object file) -> Executable File -> Loader
Procedural Programming we typically focus on a fairly specifc aim, end result
Object Oriented can be used for many different cases.
Procedural Program consists of routines, subroutines or functions are declared independent of the main program.
Java every methold needs to be in a class, C++ you cna have stand alone functions
Java applications the main() function is a static public member of a Runnable class
C++ programs must have a stand alone main() function, that should return an integer, specifically an int, to the operating system
Argument -> Function -> Return Value
header - description of people have written already
<< inseration operator
endl - new line and flushes buffer
literal have explicit fixed value
output chaining - chains of inputs
namespace std  - functionalities inside indclude library
